r"""Initializations for the Linear ODE Networks.

All initializations are normalized such that if `x~ùìù(0,1)`, then `Ax~ùìù(0,1)` as well.

Notes
-----
Contains initializations in both modular and functional form.
  - See :mod:`~.functional` for functional implementations.
  - See :mod:`~.modular` for modular implementations.
