r"""Initializations for the Linear ODE Networks.

All initializations are normalized such that if $x‚àºùìù(0,1)$, then $Ax‚àºùìù(0,1)$ as well.

Lemma
~~~~~

In this case: $e^{A}$

Notes:
    Contains initializations in both modular and functional form.
    - See `~linodenet.initializations.functional` for functional implementations.
