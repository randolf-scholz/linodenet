r"""Initializations for the Linear ODE Networks.

All initializations are normalized such that if `x‚àºùìù(0,1)`, then `Ax‚àºùìù(0,1)` as well.

Notes
-----
Contains initializations in modular form.
  - See :mod:`~linodenet.initializations.initializations.functional` for functional implementations.
